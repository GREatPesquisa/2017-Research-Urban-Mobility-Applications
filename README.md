Published on HCII 2017

Abstract
The development of applications that helps urban mobility has been pushed by the increase of processing capacity and miniaturization of the mobile device as well as the improvement of  speed and availability of Internet. Such applications can support users in several activities such as tracing routes and searching for addresses. In this scenario, this work aims to: (i) understand how users use urban mobility applications; (ii) evaluate the quality of interaction and interface in to real applications: "Waze"and "Meu Ã”nibus" and (iii) improve the applications based on the results of the evaluations. Moreover, this study also suggests a set of recommendations for urban mobility applications in sub developed countries as Brazil.

Keywords: Urban Mobility; Mobile Applications; Usability; User Experience; Evaluation Methods.
